Overview of the application


Our application is a website that helps thrifty grocery shoppers to facilitate their price comparison process. It will do so by:
- providing an organized list of items for users to choose from
- automates the gathering of price information from different stores
- tabulate the gathered information, and presents them in a “easy-to-compare” fashion in terms of “price vs. convenience”.


In addition we also want to make grocery shopping more convenient. Therefore, the application will also:
- provide an option for delivery
- accept online payment

Scenario: Jack


It’s the beginning of the week. Jack has a really tight schedule today as he has four lectures and a lab to attend, but he is running out of food at home. He then decides to use the shopping saving website to make an online order for groceries. Jack is not a first time user. He enters the main page of the website, swiftly signs in and proceeds to shopping list creation (image1).
As he doesn’t have much time, instead of browsing through our items, he quickly picks out his desired items by typing in the names while using the drop lists. Using the well-organized category, he picks out milk, cereal, apple juice, eggs, bread, spinach, chicken breast and bacon, along with his preferred types and quantities of each item (image3).The website then displays a few store options. Jack picks “Fairway" - although it is second cheapest option, it is on way between home and school. Jack then skims through the list and is satisfied (image4). He then proceeds to the next step, where he has to pick a purchase method. He chose "pick up" since he is not going to be at home for most of today (image5). Website then shows him the store information of the Fairway, and a map showing the direction from home. Jack did not need to input his address, as it is already saved under his account (image6). The website then ask for a payment method. Jack is not the biggest fan of online payment. And so he chooses to pay in person (image 8). Finally the confirmation page shows up (image9).
